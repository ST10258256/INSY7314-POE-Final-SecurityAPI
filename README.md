## How to get started using our app

1. You will have to clone or fork the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ST10258256/INSY7314-POE-PART_TWO-SecurityAPI.git
```

2.The project should work from here but there since you are using local you will have to make your own certificate but the site is secure as render passes everything already with ssl, go to step 15 if you do not mind

```bash
  choco install mkcert -y
```

3. Then you will have to install it 

```bash
  mkcert -install
```

4. Then in the local folders for frontend you will have make a certificate for your localhost this can be done as follows

```bash
  cd Frontend
  mkcert locahost 127.0.0.1 :: 1
```

5. Then you have to trust the certificate you just made

6. So click windows + r ; and then type in 

```bash
  certmgr.msc
```

7. You will jabe to go to the file on the left callled Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

8. Right Click The certificate foolder and then all tasks and then import

9. Go to where you installed the rootCA.pem and import that file. it probably be be in users/youruser/AppData/mkcert. If you are struggling to find it in that folder change the view to all files

10. You will click that then press next 

11. And then for the next option we will use Place all certificates in the following store in Trusted Root Certifcation Authorities

12. Click next and then it should be finished

13. You will have to clear your cache and restart your browser  and then it should work


14. Once you have done these steps you will be able to run the Frontend but you can run the frontend if you don't mind the frontend Certificate issues

```bash
cd Frontend
```

15. Once you have done that you will have to run the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

16. Click on the link it gives you
    
17. This will take you to your localhost on the webpage

19. This is all done over ssl and the backend is being hosted over render so you will not have to run anything else
  
21. Now you can interact with the app and make an account; login; make payments and view the payments that you have made

### Running backend locally

1. Follow the steps previously and once you have cloned the repo you must run your backend so use this code

```bash
cd Backend
dotnet build
dotnet run

```

2. Once this is done you will be running your backend locally instead and then you will have to follow the rest of the steps

### Creating your own database

If you want to make your own you will need to create a environment variable with the required information 

```bash
MONGO_URI= <connection string>
MONGO_DATABASE_NAME=<datbase name>

JWT_KEY=<yourkey>
JWT_ISSUER=<who issued it>
JWT_EXPIREMINUTES<giver expirey date>
```
